5. **Push It!**: Push your feature branch to your fork on GitHub: `git push origin your-new-feature` (replace `your-new-feature` with the name of your branch).

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Finally, go to the [Yume](https://github.com/yume-theme/yume-vscode/pulls), click on the "New Pull Request" button, describe your changes, and submit your pull request for review.

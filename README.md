**_Yume_** is an exquisitely crafted VS Code theme inspired by the Xcode IDE syntax highlighting (combined with a hint of personal charm of yours truly).

## 📖 Language syntax support

- This section is all about making your code look snazzy. We've got your back when it comes to languages like `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript` as well as `JSON`. The syntax support for other languages is going to be introduced if requested.

## ✨ Contributing

- Now, here comes the fun part. If you're itching to jump in and sprinkle some magic on this project, hop over to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/feelthatvib3/yume/CONTRIBUTING.md). We promise it's not written in ancient scrolls – just some friendly guidance on how you can jazz up this code party. And who knows, your code might just become the life of the party! 🎉

## 🙋 Feedback

- We value your feedback! If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, please feel free to [contact us](https://discord.gg/invite/A8cCcJF8wA).

And by the way, if this floats your boat, tossing a star our way would be like adding extra sprinkles on a cupcake 🧁 — it's a teensy gesture for you, but it's like a virtual high-five for us. Your support keeps us happily coding away! 🌟
